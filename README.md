# freeCodeCamp DataVisualization d 3 - treemap diagram
d3 treemap diagram visualization -- solo project from freeCodeCamp data visualization-course

This repo contains the last data-visualization from fCC data-visualization-course.
It is a treemap diagram built on my own from scratch using d3 according to user stories (see below). 

Live demo available: https://spontaneous-brioche-eca0ad.netlify.app/.

Note: There is a testscript from freeCodeCamp included confirming fullfilling of user stories.

### User Stories
User Story #1: My tree map should have a title with a corresponding id="title".

User Story #2: My tree map should have a description with a corresponding id="description".

User Story #3: My tree map should have rect elements with a corresponding class="tile" that represent the data.

User Story #4: There should be at least 2 different fill colors used for the tiles.

User Story #5: Each tile should have the properties data-name, data-category, and data-value containing their corresponding name, category, and value.

User Story #6: The area of each tile should correspond to the data-value amount: tiles with a larger data-value should have a bigger area.

User Story #7: My tree map should have a legend with corresponding id="legend".

User Story #8: My legend should have rect elements with a corresponding class="legend-item".

User Story #9: The rect elements in the legend should use at least 2 different fill colors.
